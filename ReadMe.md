This is my program to automatically upload tweaks and stuff to a github cydia repo!

I'm pretty sure that it can run without python as a dependency but idk.

It requires a specific layout of folders & files.

GITHUB PAGES REPO

-adddebs
	-Add .deb files to upload here
-debs
	-Added .deb files go here
-js,images,assets,css, ect. all other webpage attributes

-unpack bzip2 here if u dont already have it(not in a folder, all bzip2 
files go directly into the root og the github pages repo folder)

-CyUploader.exe
-index.html
-Packages(no file extention)
-Release(no file extention)

now just run CyUploader :)
